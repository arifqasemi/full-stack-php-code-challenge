# full-stack-php-code-challenge

1. Custome PHP MVC framework :

As part of the challenge, I meticulously developed a robust PHP MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework from scratch. This framework serves as the backbone for organizing code structure, facilitating efficient development, and ensuring scalability and maintainability in web applications.


2. Responsive User Interface with Bootstrap :

To enhance the user experience and ensure a visually appealing presentation, I incorporated the Bootstrap framework for creating a responsive and intuitive user interface. The use of Bootstrap elements ensures a consistent and polished design across various devices and screen sizes.



3. Client side Input Data Validation  :

In order to maintain data integrity and enhance security, I implemented client-side input data validation using carefully selected packages. These packages contribute to the validation of user inputs, ensuring that the data submitted through forms meets the required criteria and adheres to specified standards.
